<p>Vet: Welcome to the animal hospital!
Here you can explore habitats and help save endangered animals by collecting trash, doing minigames, planting trees, and learning about the endangered species and their threats. 

In each level you will have a different task to solve. Throughout the level you will collect trash points which you can use to buy things for the animal hospital. You can also find seeds and plant trees to make the habitats cleaner. 

Thank you so much for volunteering!! Have fun! To donate real money to help save animals click the DONATE button. Please choose an avatar.</p>
